              Masterminded by visual artist and illustrative musician Ofer Shouval, O. Wake has been a Brooklyn mainstay since 2019. Shouval’s probing songwriting combines elements of art pop and indie rock to explore the anxieties and absurdities of today's world through witty vignettes and sweeping soundscapes. With intimacy wrought from vulnerability and a uniquely bashful confidence, O. Wake's emerging sounds inspire play and movement while evoking a rainbow of feelings.

              Upcoming debut album draws inspiration from the richness of identity, intersection, and technology. Debut single "Riper Than Ripe" (Feb. 8, 2022) explores elements of embarrassment and shame. In the opening line, Shouval boasts about being his therapist's favorite patient, an idea he finds ridiculous (but possibly true). Written with no one around except a mirror and a cat, the song looks at how he finds energy and creates laughter and dancing by pushing through the vulnerable aspects of himself in which he finds shame. On saxophone, the song features Etienne “Teeny” Stoufflet of Tank & the Bangas.

            Shouval, who holds an MFA in Digital Media from Pratt Institute, is also the inventor of the Luminin, a motion controlled visual instrument which turns the movements of its performer into a dazzling light show. The Luminin is currently in beta stages, and will have its live show debut in 2022.

            O. Wake has performed at Brooklyn mainstays such as the Sultan Room (cap 200), Alphaville (cap 150), and the Broadway. Their first show of 2022 will be at C’Mon Everybody on February 18.

      <h3>Ofer Shouval</h3>
      <p> Ofer Shouval is a Brooklyn-based musician and visual artist whose performances
        and interactive installations explore the interplay between motion and light.
        After graduating from UT Austin with a BS in Radio Television Film,
        Shouval spent the next few years playing in bands and touring around the country.
        In these years, he became very interested in using technology to develop the visual language of live performance.
        This interest led him to enroll in the Interactive Arts program at Pratt Institute,
        receiving his MFA in May 2021. He continues to produce music under the moniker O. Wake,
        incorporating his interactive lighting systems into his live performances,
        and fostering a community of like minded artists.</p>
