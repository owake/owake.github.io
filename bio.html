              Ofer Shouval is a Brooklyn-based musician and visual artist whose performances
              and interactive installations explore the interplay between motion and light.
              After graduating from UT Austin with a BS in Radio Television Film,
              Shouval spent the next few years playing in bands and touring around the country.
              In these years, he became very interested in using technology to develop the visual language of live performance.
              This interest led him to enroll in the Interactive Arts program at Pratt Institute,
              receiving his MFA in May 2021. He continues to produce music under the moniker O. Wake,
              incorporating his interactive lighting systems into his live performances,
              and fostering a community of like minded artists.
